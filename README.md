# Simple-Connect-5-Game
A Simple Connect 5 game developed from a tic-tac-toe example during python classes.

I created this from Jose Portia's "Complete Python Bootcamp: " on [http://www.udemy.com](url).  This was created as a way to learn the basics of python.  I converted it to Python 3.64 when he changed the class to python 3. If you would like to edit this or use the python file to play the game.    Make sure you add (**_colored_**) to your distribution of python 3 or it will not work correctly.
